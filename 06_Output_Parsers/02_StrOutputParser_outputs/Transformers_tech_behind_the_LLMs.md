## 4️⃣ Core Concepts – How Transformers Work Under the Hood  

### 4.1 Tokenization & Vocabulary  

| Item | Detail | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Byte‑Pair Encoding (BPE)** | Sub‑word tokenizer cutting rarely‑seen words into morphemes | “un­**h**er‑**i**on” → ["un", "##her", "##ion"] |
| **Vocabulary Size (V)** | Number of distinct tokens | GPT‑3: *V = 50 257* |
| **Token ID → Embedding** | Map id → dense vector | Token “king” → id 1024 → 12 288‑d vector |

> *Why sub‑words?* Fewer tokens yet expressive enough; they handle OOV words gracefully.  

### 4.2 Embedding Layer  

\[
\mathbf{e}_i = \mathbf{W}_e \, \mathbf{t}_i
\]

- **\(\mathbf{W}_e\)**: **E × V** matrix (e.g., 12 288 × 50 257 in GPT‑3).  
- **\(\mathbf{t}_i\)**: One‑hot vector for token i.  

> You can visualise embeddings with t‑SNE or PCA: semantically similar words cluster together.  

### 4.3 Positional Encoding  

Because Transformers lack recurrence, they inject order via **positional encodings**:

\[
\mathbf{h}_i = \mathbf{e}_i + \mathbf{p}_i
\]

- **Sinusoidal variant** (fixed) vs. **Learned positional tokens**.  
- Allows the model to *generalise to longer sequences* beyond the training window.

### 4.4 The Attention Mechanism  

#### 4.4.1 Scaled Dot‑Product Attention  

\[
\mathbf{A} = \operatorname{softmax}\!\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{K}^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)\mathbf{V}
\]

- **Q, K, V** are linear projections of the hidden states.  
- The denominator \(\sqrt{d_k}\) stabilises gradients.  

**Intuition**: Token “king” pulls in “queen”, “England”, “royalty” because those keys align strongly with its query.  

#### 4.4.2 Multi‑Head Attention  

- Split into **H** heads: each head has its own Q, K, V projections.  
- Parallel attention captures *multiple relations* simultaneously.  

\[
\text{head}_h = \operatorname{Attention}\!\left(\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{W}_h^Q,\, \mathbf{K}\mathbf{W}_h^K,\, \mathbf{V}\mathbf{W}_h^V\right)
\]

- Concatenate all heads, then linearly transform with **\(W^O\)**.  

#### 4.4.3 Feed‑Forward Network (FFN)  

\[
\mathbf{h}^{(ff)} = \operatorname{ReLU}\!\left((\mathbf{h}^{(att)}\mathbf{W}_1)\right)\mathbf{W}_2
\]

- **\(\mathbf{W}_1\)** expands \(E\) to \(4E\); \(\mathbf{W}_2\) projects back to \(E\).  
- Residual connection & LayerNorm surround each block: improves training stability.  

### 4.5 Stacked Transformers  

- An **LLM** stacks **L** layers (GPT‑3: 96).  
- Each layer’s output becomes the next layer’s input.  
- *No recurrence or convolution*: pure attention + FFN.

### 4.6 Unembedding & Prediction  

- Final hidden state → logits:  
  \[
  \mathbf{z} = \mathbf{h}^{(\text{final})}\mathbf{W}_U
  \]
- \(\mathbf{W}_U\) often equals \(\mathbf{W}_e^\top\) (weight tying).  
- Softmax (with temperature \(T\)) → probability distribution.  
- Sampling strategies: Greedy, Top‑k, Top‑p (nucleus).  

> **Temperature** controls randomness:  
> - \(T=1\): normal sampling.  
> - \(T<1\): sharper (deterministic).  
> - \(T>1\): flatter (creative).  

### 4.7 Training Dynamics  

#### Loss  
Cross‑entropy on the next‑token prediction:
\[
\mathcal{L}_i = -\log P(y_i \mid y_{<i})
\]

#### Optimisation  
- AdamW (Adam with weight decay).  
- Warm‑up + cosine decay learning‑rate schedule.  
- Mixed‑precision & distributed data‑parallelism.  

#### Scaling Laws  
Kaplan et al. (2020) discovered that *performance scales sub‑linearly with model size, data, and compute*.  
- *10× parameters* ≈ *10–15 % better perplexity*.  
These laws guide model budgeting and hardware procurement.

## 6️⃣ Advanced Insights & Current Challenges  

### 6.1 **Scaling Laws & Compute Budgets**  
- *Kaplan et al.* (2020) [1] predict diminishing returns beyond ~10 B parameters.  
- **Energy consumption**: GPT‑3 training ≈ 1,200 MWh (~2 % of a typical data centre's annual energy).  

### 6.2 **Efficient Fine‑Tuning**  

| Technique | Idea | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|------|------|------|
| **Prefix Tuning** (Li & Liang, 2021) | Learn a small vector prefix, freeze backbone | ≤1 % parameter overhead | May under‑perform when task diverges |
| **Adapter Modules** | Insert tiny bottleneck feeds between layers | Easy to swap, no full fine‑tune | Extra hyper‑parameters |
| **Full Fine‑Tuning** | Update all weights | Maximally expressive | Risk of catastrophic forgetting |

### 6.3 **Bias & Fairness**  

- Word embeddings encode societal stereotypes (e.g., “doctor” → male).  
- Debiasing strategies: *Hard Debias* [Bolukbasi et al., 2016], *Adversarial Debias*, *Data Augmentation*.  
- Ongoing research: *bias monitoring during pre‑training* & *post‑hoc correction*.

### 6.4 **Explainability & Interpretability**  

- **Attention Maps**: Visualise which tokens attend to which; limited as a causal explanation.  
- Gradient‑based attribution (Integrated Gradients, LRP).  
- Model‑agnostic methods (LIME, SHAP) adapted for transformers.  
- Emerging idea: *Contrastive explanations* via counter‑factual prompts.

### 6.5 **Robustness & Safety**  

- **Adversarial prompts** can coax LLMs into generating harmful content.  
- Safety frameworks: *RLHF* (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), *content filters*, *policy constraints*.

## 7️⃣ Future Directions – What’s on the Horizon?  

1. **Sparse & Efficient Attention**  
   - Reformer, Longformer, BigBird: enable 10 k‑token contexts with O(N) rather than O(N²).  

2. **Unified Multimodal Foundations**  
   - Models like *Claude 3*, *PaLM‑2*, *LLaMA‑2* with vision & audio heads.  

3. **Programmable LLMs**  
   - Parameter efficient finetuning (P-EFT) to embed custom behaviour without retraining the entire network.  

4. **Differential Privacy & Federated Training**  
   - Protect training data while still scaling to billions of tokens.  

5. **Theoretical Underpinning**  
   - Better understanding of why self‑attention works *so well*; links between transformer expressivity and *language modelling capacity*.
